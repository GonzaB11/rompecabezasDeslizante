## About the Project
This project is a puzzle game that offers two game modes: a number-based mode and an image-based mode. In the numeric mode, the goal is to arrange numbers from 1 to 15 in order. In the image mode, players must place the elements in the correct order to complete the puzzle.

## Features
- **Two Game Modes**: Play with numbers or images.
- **Challenging Gameplay**: Arrange numbers or image pieces correctly to solve the puzzle.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Java Swing using Windows Builder (JFrame).
- **Separated Presentation Design**: Implements a structured approach by separating business logic from the UI.
- **Automated Testing**: Uses JUnit for testing to ensure system reliability.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language for game logic.
- **Windows Builder (JFrame)**: UI design for an interactive experience.
- **JUnit**: Framework for writing and running automated tests.
